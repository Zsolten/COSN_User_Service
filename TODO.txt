after registration, user is first pending validation, after verifying the email he's blocked until he enters the car info to his profile.
in case of deleting the last car he's blocked again.
#todo:
	[OK] authorization: make sure only admin can delete users, (and users can delete their own profiles)
	- send the verification email and then confirming the registration of users, changing the status to BLOCKED until they add a car
	- make sure users can't use any functionalities while they are blocked (apart from adding the car to their profile in order to be unblocked)
	- tokens and giving access only to certain parts of the app accordingly - different services (not only users!!!) also have to authorize in order to get data from us?
	- add the correct response codes (according to documentation)
